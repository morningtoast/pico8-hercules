IF THERE'S ROOM
- particles on land when it gets hit/chained


zones and boxes
- viewable playarea
- activation area; when items become active just before viewable
- alive area; wider around window so things can move but, debris


groups of objects/actors
- player
- bullets
- enemies
- boss
- waves/timer/spawner

landscape items; interactive
- tree
- mountain
- house
- temple
- greek pillar
- fence
- water well
- grave stones
- statue
- market stand
- pots / vessel


FLAGS - IDs are reduced by one with fget() call (1 => 0)
1=blocks player
2=shootable by player bullets


passive background landscape
- path rocks
- river/water (blocker?)
- grass
- crop fields

characters
- hercules (player)
- girl npc
- dude npc

types of mobs
- snake; different color = ranged
- scorpion
- bat/crow = fly
- ghost/spirit = fly
- dragon
- bear
- lion
- wolf
- harpy/fairy = fly
- bull
- boar/hog
- skeleton = ranged; walk-in or rise up
- crab

Mob props
- health
- sprite
- shooter?
- static or move/path

- charging mobs will turn if they hit a blocker
	- +/- 90 at each hit until it gets offscreen

- charging mob style/sprite does not matter; can be random
	


Scoring?
- mob kill w/ bullet
- mob kill w/ other mob (spin)
- npc save
- pickups (gold/gems)

- does tile get hit?
	- does it have a drop? if so, create it
		- does it change sprite?

- spin power coresponds to amount of debris when hitting things?

Lookup table for which sprites turn into which sprites when they are hit
	table => stump; mountain => rocks; house => rubble
		but need w/h of sprite key
		during sprite lookup, check if it's part of bigger sprite set


- Use map as a background so it shows destruction after object is gone
- use text string to define objects that overlay the map

- move camera on Y instead of moving background
	- only push player off bottom if it's touching an object

- what could be in each object when it's destroyed?
	- charging bad guy, which bad guy?
	- powerup
		- move speed up
		- move speed down
		- chain length up
		- chain length down
		- spin cooldown less
		- heal HP+
		- poison HP-
		- lightning = kill all in row/col
		- time stopper
		- zeus power; can chain anything for a limited time
	- secret stairs; shortcut or bonus room
	- pit hole = slows player

There can only ever be 2 maps showing
on the screen at one time
	have vars for map 1 and map 2
	so you can check relative coords
	for collisions

	- common func to answer
		- what map you're on right now
			- convert screen x/y into 
		- which tile x/y on that map are you


UI METERS
- Spin power, builds while spinning
	- determines how much power item has to destroy
- Fire repeat speed; replenished by collecting rocks
- Health
- letter + number for minors <-- WON'T FIT
	- S1 = move speed
	- C1 = chain length
	- 


what is the tile coord, on which map
	what screen x/y was that mean
what is the tile coord for the given pixel x/y

4,7

conver screen x/y using the position
of the attacker (bullet, chain) - divide by 8
to get nearest tile spot but it's not the
actual tile x/y

	tile x/y is created using the relative
	formula that is already working

	--> don't convert relatively tile x/y into
		the screen x/y

function tile_hit(ax,ay,mapid)
	local thismap=stream[mapid]

	rel_map_y=flr((ay/8)-(thismap.y/8))

	local tx=flr(thismap.mapx+ax/8)
	local ty=flr(thismap.mapy+rel_map_y)

	tilespr=mget(tx,ty)

	return fget(tilespr),tilespr,tx,ty
end
